<p style="color:white;">Body mass index (BMI) is a value derived from the mass (weight) and height of a person. The BMI is defined as the body mass in kilograms divided by the square of the body height in meters, and is expressed in units of kg/m2. The BMI may be determined using a table[note 1] or chart which displays BMI as a function of mass and height using contour lines or colours for different BMI categories, and which may use other units of measurement (converted to metric units for the calculation).[note 2] The BMI is a convenient rule of thumb used to broadly categorize a person as underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese based on tissue mass (muscle, fat, and bone) and height. Commonly accepted BMI ranges are underweight (under 18.5 kg/m2), normal weight (18.5 to 25), overweight (25 to 30), and obese (over 30).[1] BMIs under 20 and over 25 have been associated with higher all-causes mortality, with the risk increasing with distance from the 20â€“25 range.[2]</p>
